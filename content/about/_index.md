Hello there digital nomad my name is James Chip, welcome to my corner of the internet. Here you will find posts about a range of subjects including software development, modular synths, board games, electronics, tabletop RPG's, chip music and any other subject that takes my interest.

I am a software engineer by day and an avid player of board games in the evenings. I used to make chip music under the name [big-chip](https://archive.org/details/CDK007) and still make music now although the release rate is quite slow.
