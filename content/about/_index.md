Hello there digital nomad my name is James Chip, welcome to my corner of the internet. I am not really sure what it is you are supposed to write about on an about page. Some say just write about yourself, but alas I feel I might be a rather drab person to read about. Some others say don't write about yourself just write about the content. Unfortunately for me there is not a great deal of content here to be written about at the moment and as this blog is early days I don't really know what form the content will take yet. Some suggest to write about the service you can provide, and as I don't intend to offer a service from here that goes out the window too. So here is where I find myself, having not much to write about on an about page and instead writing about the about page. I is to my mind however that this about page should have something of the abouts about it and so i will now endeavour to fill it with information.

## Content

Two things that you will find here are my reading list and my project page. The reading list is what it sounds like. I found for a while that I was not reading as much as I once did and I have started to keep this list as a way to motivate me to read more often. bear in mind I am quite a slow reader so don't expect me to be updating this with a book a month. The project page is a kind of wiki for each of my projects i have in the pipeline at the moment, each project having its own page. Then there is the blog. This blog, I suspect, will mostly be a personal blog. The content of the posts you might expect to find will range from:

* Project updates on things I am working on now
* Ideas for new projects i am jotting down
* Gardening 
* Painting miniatures
* Anything else that takes my interest.

This might seem unfocused and a bit of a mess but I suppose that is haw a personal blog should be, after all, are we not all a little bit of a mess ourselves anyway?

## Me

There isn't really much to say here. I write software, I make music, I like to garden, I like to cook. Thats about it. Also my spelling and grammar are not great so please bear with me if you find spelling and punctuation errors, I am trying my best and am getting better all the time. Nobody proof reads this so what happens happens.
