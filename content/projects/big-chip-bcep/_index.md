Big-Chip was the name under which I released chip music. The name came from a bag of frozen chips that my friend had when he suggested that it might make a good name for a chip music act. I agreed but it's a crap name. This was the first release that i put out under that name. All recorded in my bedroom at my parents house one summer. This was totally lost when the big-chip website i was running went down for good in about 2010 and around the same time the hard drive that had the files on went wrong. Lucky for me a friend found a copy of it on his backup drive in 2019 and sent me a copy of it. So here it is again, the first ever big-chip e.p.
