Wine-o were a seven piece skacore band that I was in while in college.  

This first recording was done in our guitarists parents house one weekend while they were on holiday. It was recorded on a small tape 4 track using only one microphone. It primarily recorded as a demo that we posted out to promoters, venues and handed out at gigs to anyone we though could give us a gig. In the end we put a cover on it and started selling it at our gigs for Â£1 to help cover travel money.  

### Track list
