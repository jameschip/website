title: Wine-o - Unreleased recordings
---

Wine-o's last recording. Unfortunately by this time the band had started burning out a bit. The constant drinking that gave the band its name and the amount of time spent hungover and crammed in the back of a transit van for days at a time was causing relationships to strain. Coupled with the fact that we had all finished college by this point and were ready to go on with the next part of our lives it was decided to call it time. Instead off going out with a huge argument caused by continuing the project it was agreed to use the money we had left from playing gigs and selling merch that we would normally use to pay petrol and food to buy some cheap studio time and record some last songs. These I think were the best of the songs we had written. That time int the studio in particular I remember fondly, everyone was in good spirits again and we went out in a real high. That was the last time we were ever all in the same place at one time. The band ended the same way it started, with a case of special brew, a bottle of chinzano and a bong.
