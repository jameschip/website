Wine-o was the second recording that we made as a band. It was recorded in a small basement studio that someone let us use for the day because they owed us a favour. We didn't really have any idea what we were doing when recording, the studio didn't come with any staff or instructions but we muddled thorough and did the best we could. A bit of mastering was then done by someone we know.
