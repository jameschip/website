We are lucky to have woodland and wild/ farm land around the area where we live and take the opportunity to walk among the trees whenever we get the chance. In recent years however we have seen more and more land either sold to developers for housing or ,due to funding being cut to farmers to keep public access maintained on their land, access being restricted. There was actually a bridge over the river among the trees that ran along the side of a farm that I have spent a long time sitting on with my wife, legs dangling over the edge just listening to the water ripple past. The bridge is gone now, the whole area is inaccessible, and up for sale for development as I type these very words. I wrote this as a game to facilitate the exploration of woodlands and interaction with trees and wildlife. Trees are wonderful things and at the rate they are disappearing we might not have much time left to enjoy them so take the chance now.
