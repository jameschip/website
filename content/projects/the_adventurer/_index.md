The adventurer is a solo journal writing rpg, all you need to play is a standard deck of playing cards, something to write with and a bit of free time. A typical game session for me usually lasts from 30 minutes to an hour. During the game you will be writing the story of a lone adventurer in the form of journal entries documenting the day to day goings on of their travels. Game play is drawing cards and looking up their meaning on a table and then interpreting what happens by writing journal entries. With this I wanted to create an fairly open ended engine for writing stories in a fantasy setting that could be played with things i already had around the house.
