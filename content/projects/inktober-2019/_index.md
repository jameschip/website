{{< figure src="inktober-2019.jpg">}}

In 2019 I decided to do Inktober. One ink picture a day for the whole of October. I am not great at drawing but had always enjoyed it, although for quite a few years i had not drawn at all for some reason. This seemed like a good way to get back into it. One picture a day, even if you are just doodling, is still quite a thing to find the time to produce.
