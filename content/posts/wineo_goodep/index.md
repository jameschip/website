It was a hot summer weekend, Cieran had an empty house for the weekend, several bottles of cheap whisky had been procured and the air was thick with the smoke from roll ups and pipes. There was also a bottle of Noilly Prat for some reason. These were the conditions that the band I was in at the time recorded our first demo "The Good e.p." on a small tape 4 track with a single microphone that was leant to us by a guy called Thor. A "rap" was added to it a few days later for reasons that I still don't understand. 

This demo got us a whole string of gigs all over the UK (somehow) and we also shifted about 100 copies from the merch table (somehow). To be honest the recording is crap but some young punks thought it was good. I think it had more to do with the fact we were a 'good time' band known for excessive drinking and rowdy behavior coupled with being very interactive with the crowd. It always seemed to be more about the party than the music in those days.

Anyway we went on to play a lot of gigs over about 3 years, usually 1 or 2 a week, anywhere that would have us. This record isn't great, not even sure it is average, and when I listen to it it now I have mixed feelings about that whole portion of my life. Anyway if you have read this far then I am sure you deserve some kind of compensation so here it is, the first ever recording from my first non high school band.
