summary: "In which I list a whole load of paints and brushes"   
---

So i paint a few miniatures here and there and it popped into my mind that I have never made a list of all of my miniature paints. This is not a huge task for made
as I am not the kind of person that insists on having every single colour imaginable, instead I often mix my own and make do. Thats not to say i don't buy any paint
at all though. Anyway here is a list of all the little pots i have at the moment.
