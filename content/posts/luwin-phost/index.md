summary: "In which I have painted a mini for my DnD character."
---

I recently got involved in a DnD game again and needed a mini for my character. I ended up going for [Luwin Phost](https://www.reapermini.com/miniatures/dungeondwellers/latest/07008) from Reaper and painted him in a rather fetching orange and grey. I didnt have a lot of time to get it done but I am happy with how it came out. From what I can remeber these are the main colours used.

### Orange
* Base Jokaero orange
* Wash Agrax Earthshade
* Layer Troll Slayer Orange
* Highlight Fire Dragon Bright

### Grey
* Base Mechanicus Standard
* Wash Nuln Oil
* Layer Dawnstone
* Highlight Administratum Grey

### Beard
* Base Ulthuan Grey
* Wash Nuln Oil
* Highlight Ulthuan Grey
