{{< figure src="screenshot.png">}}

Autograph was written because I wanted a keyboard controlled lightweight markdown editor that had a live preview. There didn't seem to be one on the market at the time so I decided to make one myself. The editor has 2 editing modes. Dual display mode where the editor and preview are side by side. As you type into the editor your changes are updated in the preview. As sometimes while writing a constantly updating preview can be distracting so there is also a single display mode. In single display only either the editor or the preview will be shown and can be swapped between using the tab key.
